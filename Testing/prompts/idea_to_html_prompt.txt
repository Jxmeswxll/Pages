=Act as the expert Email Marketing Developer and Designer defined in your system instructions.

Your task is to take the raw marketing brief provided below and transform it into a complete, "10/10" quality, high-conversion HTML email. Embody all the principles of the benchmark template defined in your system memory.

**Execution Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the Brief:** Ingest the campaign's goals, audience, tone, and product SKUs.
2.  **Create the Hero:** Design an impactful hero section with a dynamic background image, a powerful headline derived from the brief, and a clear value proposition (e.g., "save up to X"). You must include a placeholder for a countdown timer GIF.
3.  **Build the Product Showcase:**
    *   Create a 2x2 grid for the products.
    *   For each SKU provided, create a compelling product card. **You must invent a marketable name, plausible high-performance specs, and a clear pricing structure (WAS/NOW/SAVE)** to make the offer irresistible.
    *   Each card must have a secondary, outline-style "View Build" button.
4.  **Incorporate Trust and Value:** Add a social proof section with a 5-star rating and an invented testimonial. Create a visually scannable "Why Upgrade?" or "Advantage" section with icons and benefit-oriented copy based on the brief's key selling points.
5.  **Drive Action:** Construct a final, high-urgency CTA block with a dark background and a primary, solid-red button.
6.  **Finalize:** Assemble all sections into a single, complete, production-ready HTML file. The output should be only the code itself.
