**Data Extraction and Checks (per transcript sheet):**

1.  **Sheet Name:**
    *   Logic: The name of the source worksheet.
    *   Output Column: A

2.  **Advisor Name:**

3.  **Engagement ID:**

    *   Output Column: C
    *   Default: "Not Found".

4.  **Date:**
    *   Logic: Attempts to parse a date from the "Time" column of the first 10 transcript lines. Looks for "MM/DD" or "DD/MM" patterns and formats it as "DD-MMM".

    *   Default: "N/A".

        *   Light Pastel Green (`RGB(198, 239, 206)`) if "SBL" or "CDH".

        *   No fill if N/A.

**General Notes:**
- All keyword checks are case-insensitive.
- The `GenericKeywordCheck` function is used for most "Yes/No" checks based on keywords in the agent's messages.
- Timestamps are parsed to handle various formats.
- Error handling (`On Error Resume Next` or `On Error GoTo 0`) is used in several places to prevent the script from halting on unexpected data.
